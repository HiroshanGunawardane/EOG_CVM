## ðŸ§  Overview

This project provides a robust algorithm to improve the accuracy of saccade parameter measurement using electrooculography (EOG) signals. The method fuses two estimation approaches â€” a regression-based technique and a velocity-threshold-based method â€” using a constant velocity motion model, yielding improved estimates of key saccade parameters such as amplitude, velocity, and duration.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Implements a fusion algorithm based on a **constant velocity motion model**
- Enhances the **accuracy and reliability** of saccade detection using EOG
- Provides tools for:
  - Preprocessing raw EOG signals
  - Detecting saccades
  - Estimating saccade parameters
  - Evaluating performance against ground truth
